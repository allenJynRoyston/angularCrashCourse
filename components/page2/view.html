			<h3>Setup</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Before jumping into Angular, we need to talk about the controller.  Angular can broadly broken down into 
				two main parts:  the view and the controller, or in other words, the DOM and the code.    
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				While we won't go into details on how to setup controllers (you can download the 
				source code for this site <a href='https://github.com/allenRoyston/angularCrashCourse'>here</a> and see for yourself), we will go into details on what you can 
				do IN the controller. 
				<br><br>
				The code for the controller looks like this:
				<hr>
				<pre>
// define a controller			
myApp.controller('page2Controller', function($scope) {
	
	  // code goes here
		
		
});			
				</pre>
				
		</div>	
	

		<div ng-if='focusOn=="breakdown"' class='col-xs-12'>
			<h3>Breaking it Down:</h3>
			<hr>
			<div class='col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1'>
				<p><code>myApp</code>.controller('page2Controller', function($scope){})</p>
				<hr>	
				1.) The first part, myApp, is just the name we've decided to call our application.  We declare it as 
				soon as possible, typically in the html tag.  Mind you it doesn't HAVE to be named myApp (we could
				call it anything we wanted), but lets keep it simple for this demo.  
				<br><br>
				<img src='media/images/index.jpg' class='img-responsive'>
				<hr>	
				<p>myApp.<code>controller</code>('page2Controller', function($scope){})</p>	
				<hr>	
				2.)  The second part is simply declaring that we're creating a controller, hence the aptly named <em>controller.</em>
				<hr>	
				<p>myApp.controller(<code>'page2Controller'</code>, function($scope){})</p>	
				<hr>	
				3.)  This is the name of the controller itself.  You can name this anything you want JUST so long
				as it matches what's declared in the view (html). 
				<br><br>
				<img src='media/images/controller.png' class='img-responsive'>
				<hr>	
				<p>myApp.controller('page2Controller', function(<code>$scope</code>){})</p>	
				<hr>	
				4.)  This is where our <em>modules</em> will go.  We can talk more about modules later, but for now
				just recognize modules are what you use to add functionality.  There are a wide range of modules
				you can add out the box ($timeout, $state, $interval, etc), but for right now, understand
				that $scope will be what we use to place content on to a page. 
				<br><br>
				
				5.)  Lastly, place your controller in an external script and reference it as you would a normal js file.  I 
				generally place these files in the header on the index.html page.
